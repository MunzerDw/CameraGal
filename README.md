# Mobile Camera App

This is a personal project to learn mobile development with Flutter.

My idea is to have a camera app that lets you select the target album of the image you are about to take. This enables users to have faster and better sorted pictures. For instance, if you want to take a picture of a school note you can directly select the target album of the specific subjet.
